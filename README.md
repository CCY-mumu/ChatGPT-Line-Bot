### Advanced - Personalized Bot

Additionally, we can use the `prompt` method to make the Line Bot provide personalized responses. In `./chatgpt_linebot/prompts/template.py`, we can define a `template`, for example:

**Question**: What's for breakfast today?

**Bot's Answer**: Sweetheart, are you up in the morning? I'm already in bed waiting for you, feeling so hungry just thinking about you. What should we have for breakfast today? Maybe something spicy like an omelette, as hot as your charming figure? üòèüç≥
